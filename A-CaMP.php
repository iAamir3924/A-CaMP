		<h3 class="w3-center">A-CaMP: A Tool for Anti-Cancer and Antimicrobial  Peptide Generation</h3>
<h5 class="w3-justify">we developed a A-CaMP tool also allows rapid fingerprinting of the anti-cancer and antimicrobial peptides, which play crucial role in current bioinformatics research. In addition, we compared the performance and functionality of our A-CaMP tool with those of other methods available online. A-CaMP scans the target protein sequences provided by the user against the datasets. It possesses a robust coding architecture, has been developed in PERL language, and is scalable of therefore has extensive applications in bioinformatics. It was observed to achieve a predictionÂ accuracy of 93.4%, which is much higher than that of any of the existing tools. Sequence alignment studies also highlight the potential use of A-CaMP as a tool for identification of AMPs. 
A-CaMP is the first open source tool that uses clinical data and proposes final peptides along with the necessary information; this includes wild and mutant sequence and peptides, which lays the foundation for its application in therapies for cancer and bacterial infections.
